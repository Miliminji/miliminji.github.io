        Wanting was enough
        For me, it was enough
        To live for the hope of it all
        Cancel plans just in case you'd call
        And say, "Meet me behind the mall"
        So much for summer love and saying "us"
        'Cause you weren't mine to lose
        You weren't mine to lose, no</p>

        <p id="p0">I wanna go out with you, where you wanna go? (Huh?)
            Find a lil' spot, just sit and talk
            Looking pretty, follow me, 우리 둘이 나란히
            보이지? 내 눈이 갑자기 빛나지 when you say I'm your dream <br>
            You don't even know my name, do you?
            You don't even know my name, do you?
            누구보다도 <br>
            I'm super shy, super shy
            But wait a minute while I make you mine make you mine
            떨리는 지금도 you're on my mind all the time
            I wanna tell you but I'm super shy, super shy</p>
